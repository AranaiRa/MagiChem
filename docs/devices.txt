Actuator
    A device attached to a Centrifuge, Distillery,
    Requires an input about once a second or so to either rotate left, right, pull out, pull in. Each operation consumes Mana.
    Can be automated with a Construct.
    Manual actuating improves machine efficiency to 100%, Construct automation improves it based on Intelligence (though one Construct can handle multiple devices)

Alembic
    A simple device that performs Distillation. Requires a heat source, 50% baseline efficiency.

Centrifuge
    A device used to perform Separation. Requires FE, 75% baseline efficiency.
    Speed can be improved by increasing power draw.
    Efficiency can be improved with an Actuator.

Circle of Fabrication
    A device that performs Fabrication. Requires FE.
    Speed can be improved by increasing power draw.

Circle of Inundation
    A device that performs Inundation. Requires FE.
    Speed can be improved by increasing power draw.

Circle of Power
    A device that uses up to four Reagents to generate FE.

Conjunctor
    A device that performs Fixation. The more advanced form of the Vessel. Requires FE, 75% baseline efficiency.
    Speed can be improved by increasing power draw.
    Efficiency can be improved with an Actuator.

Distillery
    A device that breaks down an object or fluid into its component materia. The more advanced form of the Alembic. Requires FE, 75% baseline efficiency.
    Speed can be improved by increasing power draw.
    Efficiency can be improved with an Actuator.

Vessel
    A simple device that performs Fixation. Requires a heat source, 50% baseline efficiency.
